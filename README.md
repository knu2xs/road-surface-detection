# road-surface-detection

This is an example road crack detection deep learning workflow using an ArcGIS Learn Single Shot Detection model. This
running demonstration was built off the example notebook with a _lot_ more detailed theoretical explanation included in
the [Esri documentation demonstrating road surface investigation](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/sample-notebooks/automate-road-surface-investigation-using-deep-learning).

## Getting Started

After cloning the directory, everything you need is in the three notebooks in the [notebook directory](./notebooks). 
They are numbered, and are in order. The first notebook sets up all the data, and you only need to run it once. The 
second, trains the model, and the last demonstrates inferencing.
